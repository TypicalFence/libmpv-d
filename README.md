# libmpv-d

Bindings to libmpv.

## Building

```bash
dub build --config=mpv
```

## Examples

There are some examples, you can build them by using a different config:

```bash
dub build --config=mpvd-play
```

## Versioning
The idea is to follow mpv's version as closely as possible and to use the `PATCH` number for necessary patches, just in case.
